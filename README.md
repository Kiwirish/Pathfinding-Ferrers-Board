# Pathfinding Shortest Path to target Ferrers Board / Partition.

### Project focused on pathfinding within partitions represented by Ferrers boards. 
### This explores the shortest path from an initial partition to a goal partition using Breadth-First-Search algorithms to efficiently navigate this path and perform moves toward the goal partition. 
### The goal is to find the shortest sequence of moves required to transform the intitial partition into the final partition. 

My final PathfindingPartitions program is within PathfindingPartitions.py file. 

To compile and run my program enter: 

python3 PathfindingPartitions.py < testFileName.txt
